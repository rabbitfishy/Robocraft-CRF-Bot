# Robocraft-CRF-Bot

This is a repository for my robocraft bots and desgins
some of them taken from back when robocraft was fun
known as the golden days of robocraft.
sadly fj decided to delete robocraft and given up any attempts of saving
the game that it was once loved by many.
some of the bot include the time when ROSEFALL was around and many other
robocraft youtubers from 2016 - 2017.

This is favorite bot that i've bult yet.
This was in the crf when ROSEFALL reviewed bots from it and no youtube tutorials
on how to build this one, so i decided to look at the video carefully and replicated the build.
Since ROSEFALL's Milano is difficult to fly and looks really bulky which i disliked.
This bot is very stable and agile, one of my best and most proud build.
